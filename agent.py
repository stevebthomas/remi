"""
Remi — Conflict Resolution Agent

Core AI layer. Receives two developers' code changes and their stated intents,
analyzes for semantic conflicts, and produces a merged resolution using Claude Opus 4.6.

Also handles:
- Intent inference via Claude Haiku 4.5 (called on every file save)
- Intent registry sync with the server
- Cross-file risk flag generation
- Learned pattern accumulation across merges
