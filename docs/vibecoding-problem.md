# The Vibecoding Collaboration Problem

## What is vibecoding?

Vibecoding refers to development workflows where AI assistants (Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) generate large chunks of code in response to high-level prompts. The developer guides the AI, accepts or rejects suggestions, and iterates — but may not deeply understand every line produced.

This is increasingly common. It's fast, it unlocks developers who previously couldn't build certain things, and it produces real, working software.

## The new collaboration failure mode

Traditional conflict detection (git) was designed for humans who write code they understand, line by line. Git catches *syntactic* conflicts: two people edited the same line, so git flags it.

Vibecoding creates a new category of problem that git misses entirely: **semantic intent conflicts**.

**Scenario:**
Two developers are building a game simultaneously, both using AI assistants.

- Developer A's AI restructures the physics system to be event-driven, decoupling collision detection from the game loop. The AI touches `physics.py`, `game_loop.py`, and `constants.py`.
- Developer B's AI adds a new enemy type that calls the old synchronous collision interface directly. It touches `enemy_ai.py`, `physics.py`, and `game_loop.py`.

Neither developer fully understands the full scope of what their AI changed. When they push:

- git sees no conflict on `enemy_ai.py` (only B touched it)
- git sees a conflict on `physics.py` (both touched it) and produces a merge
- The merge is syntactically valid — it compiles
- At runtime, the new enemy AI calls a function signature that no longer exists
- The game crashes

**The gap:** git resolved the conflict at the syntax level. Nobody resolved it at the intent level. The right resolution would have been: "B's enemy AI needs to use the new event-driven interface A built."

## Why pre-push matters

Post-push is too late for intent resolution. By the time a PR is opened:
- The AI context that generated the code is gone
- The developer may not remember the intent behind each change
- The conflict has already propagated into shared history

Pre-push, Remi captures intent *at the moment of generation* — when it's still fresh and accurate — and uses it to detect and resolve conflicts before they're committed.

## Why this is hard to solve with existing tools

- **Linters/type checkers:** catch type-level incompatibilities, not design-level ones
- **PR reviews:** depend on a human reviewer understanding both sides of the conflict
- **git merge strategies:** operate on text, not meaning
- **Communication (Slack, standups):** don't scale to the velocity of AI-assisted development

Remi's approach: capture intent continuously, detect conflicts early, resolve with an AI agent that has access to both developers' intent and the full codebase context.
